# Mobit Documentation Introduction

Welcome to the Mobit documentation, where you will find comprehensive guides on querying blockchain data using GraphQL. This guide assumes that you have a foundational understanding of GraphQL concepts, including queries, mutations, and types. If you are new to GraphQL, we recommend starting with the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/).

## GraphQL Endpoints

Mobit provides two primary GraphQL endpoints for querying blockchain data:

1. **CKB Index Testnet Endpoint**:
   - **URL**: [https://unistate-ckb-test.unistate.io/v1/graphql](https://unistate-ckb-test.unistate.io/v1/graphql)
   - **Usage**: Ideal for testing and development on the CKB test network.

2. **CKB Index Mainnet Endpoint**:
   - **URL**: [https://ckb-graph.unistate.io/v1/graphql](https://ckb-graph.unistate.io/v1/graphql)
   - **Usage**: Perfect for production applications interacting with the mainnet CKB network.

These endpoints enable you to execute complex queries to retrieve various types of blockchain data, including addresses, blocks, transactions, tokens, NFTs, and more.

## Document Structure

This document is organized into several sections, each focusing on different core types within the Mobit GraphQL schema and their respective fields. Below is a brief overview of the key sections:

1. **Core Types**
   - Overview of basic types such as `addresses`, `block_height`, and `transaction_outputs_status`.
   - Common query examples for retrieving and analyzing these core types.

2. **RGBPP Types**
   - In-depth explanation of the RGB++ system, which facilitates cross-chain asset transfers between Bitcoin and CKB.
   - Details on RGB++ locking scripts (Locks) and unlocking scripts (Unlocks), as well as managing asset states.

3. **Spore Types**
   - Comprehensive introduction to the Spore NFT system, including `spores` and `clusters`.
   - Examples of querying individual Spores, clusters, and related operations.

4. **Token Types**
   - Introduction to the XUDT (User-Defined Token) system, including `token_info` and `xudt_cell`.
   - Query examples for retrieving token information, balances, and transaction histories.

Each section includes detailed descriptions of GraphQL types, field specifications, and practical query examples using the `LightGraphQLPlayground` component. These examples will assist you in constructing and executing queries against the Mobit GraphQL endpoints.

## Getting Started

To begin querying data from the Mobit GraphQL endpoints, follow these steps:

1. **Access GraphQL Playground**: Navigate to one of the provided endpoints using your browser.
2. **Write Your Queries**: Use the GraphQL Playground interface to write and execute your queries.
3. **Explore Examples**: Refer to the examples in the documentation for inspiration and guidance.

By leveraging the powerful features of GraphQL, you can efficiently retrieve and analyze blockchain data to build robust applications and integrate with the Mobit ecosystem.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to our support team or community forums for assistance. Enjoy your querying!
